WARNING: This project is still being developed, and is not ready for use.

== Overview

This project exists as a self-imposed challenge. My goal is to build a piece of desktop software using:

* JavaFX/FXML
* SceneBuilder

Which:

* Stores documents in an encrypted and/or password protected sqlite database.
* Provides access to the database:
** Loading files from it,
** Saving files to it,
** Updating/Deleting files in it

== Current Status

* *UI:* _In progress, tentative final planning draft complete._
* *SERVICE:* _In progress, next major step is implementing Concurrency with the DMZManager._
